# Lifting State

A common question from React beginners is how to share state between two sibling
components. The answer is to
["lift the state"](https://react.dev/learn/sharing-state-between-components)
which basically amounts to finding the lowest common parent shared between the
two components and placing the state management there, and then passing the
state and a mechanism for updating that state down into the components that need
it.
