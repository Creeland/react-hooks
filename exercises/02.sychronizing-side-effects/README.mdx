# Synchronizing Side-Effects

`useEffect` is a built-in hook that allows you to run some custom code
after React renders (and re-renders) your component to the DOM. It accepts a
callback function which React will call after the DOM has been updated:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
	// your side-effect code here.
	// this is where you can interact with browser APIs for example
})
```

`useState` is for managing our react component state and `useEffect` is for
synchronizing the our react component state with the everything outside our
react components.

For example, things outside our react components include:

- Browser APIs like local storage/document title/media devices/etc.
- Integrations with non-react code

This will make more sense after finishing the exercise. So come back!
