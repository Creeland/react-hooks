# DOM Side-Effects

Often when working with React you'll need to interact with the DOM directly. You
may need to use a vanilla-js (non-framework-specific) library that needs to
interact with directly with the DOM. Often to make a UI accessible you need to
consider focus management requiring you to call `.focus()` on an input.

Remember that when you do: `<div>hi</div>` that's actually syntactic sugar for a
`React.createElement` so you don't actually have access to DOM nodes in your
render method. In fact, DOM nodes aren't created at all until the
`ReactDOM.render` method is called. Your component's render method is really
just responsible for creating and returning React Elements and has nothing to do
with the DOM in particular.

So to get access to the DOM, you need to ask React to give you access to a
particular DOM node when it renders your component. The way this happens is
through a special prop called `ref`.

Here's a simple example of using the `ref` prop:

```tsx
function MyDiv() {
	const myDivRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)
	useEffect(() => {
		const myDiv = myDivRef.current
		// myDiv is the div DOM node!
		console.log(myDiv)
	}, [])
	return <div ref={myDivRef}>hi</div>
}
```

After the component has been rendered, it's considered "mounted." That's when
the useEffect callback is called and so by that point, the ref should have
its `current` property set to the DOM node. So often you'll do direct DOM
interactions/manipulations in the `useEffect` callback.

Every element has a special `ref` prop (as shown above). You pass a ref to that
prop and React will give you a reference to the thing that's created for that
element.

ðŸ“œ Learn more about `useRef` from the docs:
https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref

ðŸ¦‰ Note, sometimes the DOM interaction will make observable changes to the UI.
In those cases you'll want to use `useLayoutEffect` and we cover that in the
"Advanced React Hooks" workshop.

ðŸ¦‰ A ref is basically state that's associated to a React component that will not
trigger a rerender when changed. So you can store whatever you'd like in a ref,
not just DOM nodes. Think of a ref like this:

```tsx
const myRef = useState({ current: null })[0]

// you are now free to mutate the value of myRef.current
```

Keep in mind, React can't track when you change a ref value. That's part of it's
appeal in some cases and it can cause trouble in others. You'll develop the
intuition of when to use which over time, but in general it's best to start with
state if you're unsure and then move to a ref if you decide you don't want a
rerender when it's updated. We'll dive deeper into non-DOM refs in future
workshops.

ðŸ¦‰ If you run your application
[in strict mode](https://react.dev/reference/react/StrictMode#strictmode), one
of the things it does is run your `useEffect` callback twice. This is intended
to help you find bugs in your code. It's important to note that in production,
`StrictMode` does nothing, so this will only happen development. However, I
personally find this to cause more trouble than it's worth and do not develop
my React applications with StrictMode enabled, but it's definitely something
you should be aware of.
