# Refs

In this step we're going to use a completely different example. We're going to
make a `<Tilt />` component that renders a div and uses the `vanilla-tilt`
library to make it super fancy.

The thing is, `vanilla-tilt` works directly with DOM nodes to setup event
handlers and stuff, so we need access to the DOM node. But because we're not the
one calling `document.createElement` (React does) we need React to give it to
us.

So in this exercise we're going to use a `ref` so React can give us the DOM node
and then we can pass that on to `vanilla-tilt`.

Additionally, we'll need to clean up after ourselves if this component is
unmounted. Otherwise we'll have event handlers dangling around on DOM nodes that
are no longer in the document which can cause a memory leak.

To be clear about the memory leak, just imagine what would happen if we mount a
tilt element, then unmount it (without cleaning up). Those DOM nodes hang around
because the event listeners are still listening to events on them (even though
they're no longer in the document). Then let's say we mount a new one and
unmount that again. Now we have two sets of DOM nodes that are still in memory,
but not being used. We keep doing this over and over again and eventually our
computer is just keeping track of all these DOM nodes we don't need it to.
That's what's called a memory leak. So it's really important we clean up after
ourselves to avoid the performance problems associated with memory leaks.
